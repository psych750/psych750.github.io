    "## Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging is an extremely helpful tool in version control systems. Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. For example, when working with teammate on the same code, you may each want to  work on different branches. You'll need to merge their work together to combine it. Similarly, you might have each edited the same section. Merging allows you to resolve conflicts between multiple versions of a code before submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Make sure the branch is up to date:\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to make sure you have pulled the most recent version of the submission. You can do this with a checkout. (See above: Check out a particular commit):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout <tag name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merge the main branch into your branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is about merging your branch with the main project. If there are conflicts you will see them here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge origin/main\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you see conflicts in the form of an error message, you will have to edit them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Push the updated feature branch back to Github\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've manually resolved any conflicts, and merge no longer states there ae conflicts. You can push the updated branch back to github\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git push origin <tag name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "When working on a larger or more complicated project it is often best to add a tag to the merge and indicate to your teammates that conflicts have been resolved. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast-forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Like merging, fast-forward can be extremely helpful while working in groups. A fast-forward is a type of merge that is available when there are no new branches and you simply want to catch up to the latest version by bringing your main branch up to date with your personal branch. It's the simplest kind of merge because you're just moving forward in the timeline and catching up to the most recent version. \n",
    "\n",
    "First you will want to use fetch to make sure you are up to date with the Github repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git fetch origin\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, you will want to switch to the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then bring the main branch up to date with merge\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge <tag name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If your 'feature-branch' has only moved forward from where 'main' was when you started (meaning no one else has updated 'main' since you branched off), Git will perform a fast-forward. However, if main has been updated there will be conflicts as discussed above (see \"Merging\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a way to move forward to catch up to the latest version of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rewind\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewinding in Git is often referred to as \"reverting\" or \"resetting.\" It's used when you want to go back to an earlier version of a project locally. Note that this is different from undoing a push. Undoing a push is about changing the shared repository on github. Rewind is about changing the version of the code in your own workspace, whether or not you've shared it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will want to identify which version you want to go back to. Like with undoing a push (see above), you will need the hash code from the version you want to return to. You can see the hash code in the git log (see \"See the Git log\" above\"). This will show you a list of recent commits, each with its own commit hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've found the commit you want to go back to, you can use the \"git reset\" command to rewind to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to keep the changes you made after that commit as unsaved work in your files (so you can edit them), you can do a mixed reset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git reset --mixed {your hash}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is done locally. Also note that unlike undoing a push, this does not permanently delete and rewrite the history of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to rewind the shared version while keeping a shared history of those changes, you will want to use a different command. Revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the commit you are reverting. This maintains a history of both the original change and the fact that the change was later undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git revert {your hash}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, \"git reset\" only affects your local repository, and \"git revert\" is for when you need to undo changes that your teammates may have already seen or pulled into their own local repositories.\n"
