    "# Exercise 3: Extending the Stroop effect\n",
    "\n",
    "[Accept the exercise](https://classroom.github.com/a/ecZMU1tX).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll be extending the Stroop effect task you coded for Exercise 2 into a more complete experiment that (1) generates stimulus lists that are then read in by the main script, (2) accept runtime variables to assign participants to conditions and record participant codes, and (3) use some out-of-the-box speech recognition to allow participants to respond by using their voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the all same stimuli, but introduce several variations: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. We'll vary the proportion of trials that are incongruent (i.e., when the color of the font does not match the word). Make sure you go through the [randomization notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/trial_generation.html) first!\n",
    "\n",
    "b. We'll introduce an orientation manipulation so that on 50% of trials the word is presented upside down (what effect do you think this will have on response times?)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. The output will now be written to a results file (teaching you file access in the process).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll also start modularizing the code so that one part of it is responsible for generating the trials, another for reading in the trial list, another for showing the stimuli, and another for writing the participant's responses to a file. This is preparation for coding larger projects.\n"
