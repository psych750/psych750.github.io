    "This exercise will introduce you to some new features: We'll look at how we go about loading external files, we'll see how we deal with mouse clicks. Finally, we'll be continuing our quest to further modularize code by offloading common tasks -- those tasks not specific to this experiment -- to a separate function library. As a result our main code file will be much smaller and cleaner, containing only the code necessary for this specific experiment. \n",

    "The names are being pulled from the official roster. If you'd like to use a different name for this exercise, send me a message on Slack and I'll update it. Since the names file is being automatically pulled from github, it will magically update in your code! If you'd like to use a different image, send me an image with the same dimensions as the ones in the stimuli folder and I'll update that too (those will *not* be automatically updated for everyone unless they re-pull the code from the exercise 5 starter repository)\n",

You will then need to click on the picture of the named person as quickly as possible. You'll need to do some string manipulation to get the names in the right order and to figure out how to match the images to the name so that you can record whether the subject clicked on the correct image.\n",

Separate multiple functions with a comma just like we do when importing the various parts of psychopy. You can import all of them with  `from my_first_function_library import *` \n"
