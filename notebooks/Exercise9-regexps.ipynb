    "# Part 6: Redacting text\n",

    "Back in 2001 (before many of your were born?!) the company [Enron filed for bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) in what became the largest financial scandal in American Economics in decades (up until the 2008 crash and the [Bernie Madoff affair ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Madoff#Investment_scandal)stole the spotlight. The investigation of Enron's finances resulted in the release of many thousands of internal emails and this dataset became a widely studied example of corporate communication. When these types of materials are released to the public, it is common to redact sensitive information such as names, emails, and phone numbers. In this final part of the exercise, you'll be asked to write a script to redact names, emails and phone numbers from a handful of emails. Your solution should scale to a much larger corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code contains a file `enronemail.txt`. Your code should read in this file and process it using various regular expressions so that it looks like `enronemail-redacted.txt`. Specifically, you'll notice that the names have been converted to `(name redacted)`, emails with `(email redacted)`, and phone numbers with `(phone number redacted)`. You can hard-code the specific first and last names to redact, but your code for emails and phone numbers should be flexible to accommodate various emails and phone numbers (as in parts 4 and 5). You can (and should!) use the code you already wrote for parts 4 and 5. Your code should write a file `enronemail_redacted_teamname.txt` and push it along with your code when you submit. If your solution is correct, the file should be nearly identical to `enronemail-redacted.txt` \n",

    "One of the first emails in the file is `a..shankman@enron.com` which violates [email-address specifications](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1). Since these emails are from >20 years ago, the addresses may not be conforming to the revised specs *or* the email address got mangled somehow. In any case, make sure it too is redacted for this part of the assignment (it involves simplifying the regular expression you used for part 5). \n",
