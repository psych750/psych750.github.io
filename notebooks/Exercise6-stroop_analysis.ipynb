    "Because you'll submitting a continuous notebook (rather than developing a program) for this exercise, there's no need to have multiple tags. I encourage you though to make regular commits as you're working on the assignment. The final commit should be tagged `Exercise_6_done` and have a single notebook called exercise_6.Rmd that has clearly titled chunks (see starter code). Insert additional chunks as you see fit. Make sure you push *all* the files in your working directory to the repository, not just the Rmd file. This will help us run your code. To help us grade quickly, make sure to also include a knitted .html file. \n",

    "Inside the data subfolder are individual data files. Each file has a column header and is comma-delimitted. We need to read them into a single R dataframe (`dat`).  The starter code provides a way for you to read all these files into a single R data-frame. I would also like you to practice doing this by concatenating all the files in your shell. See [here](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/Shell_reference.html#combine-concatenate-two-or-more-files-and-write-the-output-to-another-file) for how to concatenate multiple files into one (the only slightly tricky part is what to do about the column headers). \n",

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11433432/how-to-import-multiple-csv-files-at-once) for a discussion and time comparison of the different functions. Different functions also have different column-type defaults (e.g., reading in a column containing text-strings as factors vs. character vectors).\n",
