    "### How to prevent a Turker from participating in a HIT related to one they've done before\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to run a study with several between-subject conditions,\n",
    "or run several related studies and don't want the same people to\n",
    "participate in more than one condition/study. If you post multiple HITs,\n",
    "each linking to a study or condition, there is nothing to prevent some\n",
    "of the same people from participating in all of them. The most general\n",
    "way of solving this problem is to store in a database who did what\n",
    "study, store their IDs and prevent people from doing a related study by\n",
    "looking up their ID in a database and only allowing them to do the study\n",
    "if they haven't already done one that disqualifies them. In my lab we\n",
    "have a system like this in place, but it still needs to be tested, so\n",
    "stay tuned for info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With Qualtrics (a workaround rather than a solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "For people using Qualtrics, there is a much simpler solution. Simply set up your\n",
    "task to include a 'Randomizer' element (in Survey Flow) and include\n",
    "multiple branches. This lets you funnel people to just condition A, just\n",
    "condition B, 50/50, etc. Play around with it. It's very flexible, and\n",
    "the best part is that you can make these changes after your HIT is live\n",
    "on Turk. So, for example, if you realize you want another condition, you\n",
    "can add an extra branch, add questions to it, and start funneling people\n",
    "to it through Survey Flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You may notice that although you've set Qualtrics to present\n",
    "the conditions in the randomizer equally, the final data has more of one\n",
    "type than the other. From what I can tell this is due to incomplete\n",
    "surveys which are counted by the randomizer. The only way I've found to\n",
    "overcome this is by manually setting the numbers to make up for a lower\n",
    "N in one condition or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TurkGate (a real solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you self-host, Mechanical Turk participation can be managed very\n",
    "efficiently with [TurkGate](http://gideongoldin.github.io/TurkGate/),\n",
    "which stands for **G**rouping and **A**ccess\n",
    "**T**ools for **E**xternal surveys (for use\n",
    "with Amazon Mechanical **Turk**).\n",
    "\n",
    "TurkGate is a nifty open source web application designed by Adam Darlow\n",
    "and Gideon Goldin. Installation is very simple (again, if you self-host)\n",
    "and the application has an easy-to-use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, TurkGate can be used to generate HTML/javascript that,\n",
    "when inserted into your HIT, serves as a \"doorway\" between mTurk\n",
    "workers and your survey. TurkGate allows you to allow or deny\n",
    "participation based on that worker's previously accepted HITs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic setup is the same as described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Create a new survey using, e.g., Qualtrics.\n",
    "-   Create a new survey group in TurkGate.\n",
    "    -   Start the TurkGate application by navigating to the installation\n",
    "        directory in your browser. This might be something like\n",
    "        yourhost.edu/TurkGate/\n",
    "    -   Paste in your survey URL and give your new survey group a name.\n",
    "        **Note:** this group name will be displayed to the\n",
    "        workers by default.\n",
    "    -   Click the `Generate HIT` button to generate TurkGate's default\n",
    "        code.\n",
    "-   Create a new HIT in Mechanical Turk and paste in the code from\n",
    "    TurkGate.\n",
    "-   Before you run a new batch, edit your survey to send participants to\n",
    "    the URL generated by TurkGate at the end. See the Worker IDs section\n",
    "    below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/Turkgateapplication.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now any worker who accepts a HIT via the TurkGate \"doorway\" will have\n",
    "their worker ID associated with the group name that you provided for the\n",
    "survey, and won't be allowed reentry. That is, you can create\n",
    "completely new surveys and completely new Mechanical Turk HITs, and if\n",
    "the surveys are associated with a particular group in the TurkGate\n",
    "database, workers will be prevented from participating twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "TurkGate uses a different system for generating and verifying completion\n",
    "codes than the above. However, you can still configure TurkGate to\n",
    "include worker IDs in the survey URL so they can be parsed by your\n",
    "survey provider (see\n",
    "[here](https://github.com/gideongoldin/TurkGate/wiki/Configuring-turkgate)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TurkGate Manager (an extension of TurkGate)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're like us, the need to exclude participants from certain HITs\n",
    "was present before TurkGate. Pierce wrote a TurkGate Manager class in\n",
    "python that can be used to communicate with both the MySQL database that\n",
    "stores the TurkGate survey request information and Amazon Mechanical\n",
    "Turk API to fetch worker IDs from previously completed HITs. This way\n",
    "you can flexibly add and remove worker IDs to control group management\n",
    "via TurkGate. Eventually these management tools might be possible\n",
