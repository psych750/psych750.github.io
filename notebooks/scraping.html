He first appeared in the season two episode &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; when Homer is informed by his father Abe, after the latter suffered a mild heart attack, that he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as &#39;Gaby&#39;). A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to &#39;the Simpson gene&#39;, which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejected Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant.[56] The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon.[57] Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result, the producers decided to make a sequel.[50] Herb re-appeared the next season in &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;. Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which he used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness.[58] Homer&#39;s &quot;seldom seen half-brother&quot;[59] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode &quot;The Changing of the Guardian&quot;, in which Powell&#39;s answering machine message is heard: &#39;Hi, you&#39;ve reached Herb Powell. I&#39;m poor again.&#39;[60][non-primary source needed]
* 

* Abbey (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) – Abbey is hinted to be Abe&#39;s illegitimate daughter and Homer&#39;s half-sister from a relationship he had with a British woman named Edwina during World War II.[61]

Dr. Simpson resembles Lisa, minus the spikes.

* 

* A group of unnamed relatives show up in the episode &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot;, when Homer tries to prove to Lisa that not all Simpsons are failures.[63] In the end, only Dr. Simpson and three other female members proved successful.
*

He and Bart were separated as babies by Dr. Hibbert and was deemed &quot;evil&quot;. To hide the secret, Marge and Homer chained Hugo in the attic and fed him fish heads once a week. Later, Bart goes up to the attic and Hugo escapes, wanting to sew him and Bart back together. Dr. Hibbert managed to catch Hugo, but notices that the surgical scar is on the wrong side, meaning Bart is the evil twin. As a result, Hugo is released while Bart is chained in the attic. Hugo resembles Bart, but with ratty clothes, messy hair, and malformed teeth. Since he is a Treehouse of Horror character, he does not exist in the main episode continuity.

* Cyrus Simpson (voiced by Hank Azaria) - Cyrus is Grampa&#39;s older brother who is seen in &quot;Simpsons Christmas Stories&quot;. Cyrus crashed his Corsair at Tahiti in World War II&#39;s Pacific Theater of Operations during a kamikaze raid. He never left and has 15 wives.[67]
* 

* Rita LaFleur (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) – Rita is the second wife of Abraham Simpson and a jazz recording artist.[68][69] She was a singer at Spiro&#39;s Restaurant and met Abe when he was a waiter. They married[70] and LaFleur left the restaurant, wishing to become a successful singer. She was invited to tour in Europe, but Homer suffered a head injury and Abraham realized that Homer was defenseless and would not survive in Europe, so he stayed behind with him while Rita went to Europe, and the two never saw each other again.

In &quot;Gone Abie Gone&quot;, Rita reunited with Abraham and they played piano.[71] It was unknown why they were not together.[72][73]

A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit.

Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejected Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant.[56] The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon.[57] Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result, the producers decided to make a sequel.[50] Herb re-appeared the next season in &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;.

In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness.[58] Homer&#39;s &quot;seldom seen half-brother&quot;[59] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode &quot;The Changing of the Guardian&quot;, in which Powell&#39;s answering machine message is heard: &#39;Hi, you&#39;ve reached Herb Powell.

A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived.

When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his fetish involving aquarium fish, Selma knows this is a line she will not cross, and they divorce.
*

* 

* Great-Uncle Hubert – Great Uncle Hubert is Bart, Lisa, and Maggie&#39;s great uncle who died in the short &quot;The Funeral&quot;. It is unknown which side of the family he came from or how he died. He is only mentioned once. At the funeral, Bart views his great uncle&#39;s corpse, which makes Bart turn green and faint. Later, Bart is seen running away up a hill with Lisa and Maggie, resulting in Homer and Marge scolding them in the car.
* 

* Dot – Dot is the cousin of Marge, Patty and Selma. She gave Selma a video camera at her wedding to Sideshow Bob. This is the only time she is mentioned.

She was first mentioned in the series premiere in a Christmas letter Marge is writing where she explains that Snowball died that year and went to &quot;kitty heaven&quot;. Snowball was named due to her white fur. Snowball was, according to Lisa in a poem, run over by a Chrysler belonging to Mayor Quimby&#39;s brother &quot;Clovis&quot;.[93] She is seen during Bart&#39;s escalator ride to Heaven in the second-season episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot; and in flashback in the ninth-season episode &quot;Lisa&#39;s Sax&quot;. Bart unsuccessfully tries to revive her in &quot;Dial Z for Zombies&quot;.
* 

* Snowball II – (voiced by Frank Welker[92] and Dan Castellaneta[78]) Snowball II was the Simpson family&#39;s second cat. Although Snowball I had white fur, which inspired her name, Snowball II had black fur. She first appeared in the series premiere but has received little attention in the series. Snowball II and Santa&#39;s Little Helper have always been shown as having a good relationship; usually they are seen sleeping near each other. Snowball II&#39;s largest role is in the fourteenth season episode &quot;Old Yeller Belly&quot;, in which she saves Homer from a burning treehouse. She also has minor roles in &quot;Bart Gets an Elephant&quot;, where she tries to get attention; in &quot;Two Dozen and One Greyhounds&quot;, in which she is scared by the many puppies; and in &quot;Make Room for Lisa&quot;, in which Lisa has a hallucination where she becomes Snowball II.

* 

* Pinchy – Pinchy was Homer&#39;s pet lobster in &quot;Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;&quot;. Homer went to the supermarket to buy a lobster that he could cook for dinner. Homer found that the big lobsters were too expensive, so he bought a smaller lobster with the intention of fattening him up, but he grew attached to the lobster and decided to keep him as a pet instead, naming him Pinchy. At the end of the episode, Homer puts Pinchy in a hot bath, but accidentally boils and kills him. Since his body is cooked, a sobbing Homer eats Pinchy&#39;s remains, saying that &quot;That&#39;s what he would want&quot;.
* 

* Mojo – Mojo was the helper monkey Homer had in the episode &quot;Girly Edition&quot;. Mojo, an intelligent and highly trained service animal when Homer adopted him, quickly adapted to match Homer&#39;s lazy and unhealthy lifestyle. When Mojo&#39;s condition severely worsens, Homer, fearing the repercussions of potentially having the monkey die under his watch, drops him off at the adoption center.
* 

* Strangles – Strangles was a green tree python that Bart owned during the episode &quot;Stop or My Dog Will Shoot&quot;, during which time Santa&#39;s Little Helper was a police dog.

<p>There are some false alarms, but it works pretty well! You might wonder whether this is too much trouble to go through just to get the Simpsons characters. But of course the identical code will work on pretty much <em>any</em> wiki article. And this general approach can be used on any webpage. And that’s really the point.</p>

CNN —

An incredibly bright flash that appeared in the night sky in February was the result of a star straying too close to a supermassive black hole, meeting its untimely end there as it was ripped to shreds.

But the rare cosmic event actually occurred 8.5 billion light years away from Earth, when the universe was just a third of its current age — and it has created more questions than answers.

The signal from the luminous explosion, known as AT 2022cmc, was first picked up by the Zwicky Transient Facility at the California Institute of Technology’s Palomar Observatory on February 11.
