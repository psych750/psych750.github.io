    "For **experiment projects**, your submission should include your presentation slides, executable experiment code and necessary materials, and a brief (think 2-3 pages at most) narrative explaining the project rationale and design. Your code should be written adhereing to the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide. Make sure to use informative variable names. Document your functions using [DOCSTRINGS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/). Regular python comments should be reserved for code that you think is not self-explanatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **data-analysis projects**, your submission should include your presentation slides, raw data that you're working with, R (or Python) notebooks **both raw and compiled/knitted** (HTML or PDF). If you're using R, use Rmd. If you're using Python, use Jupyter (.ipynb). I personally recommend using Python for pre-processing your data and sticking with R for actual analysis. The markdown file should contain sufficient narrative to explain your analyses and graphs. **Please do not** just have a sequence of R code blocks. Include text above/below explaining what's going on, sequencing it in a logical way so that a reader can proceed from the beginning and understand what each analysis and graph that follows is conveying. **Please do** organize the markdown file neatly using nested headings (#, ## etc.). For compactly reporting several very similar results, using [tabsets](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/html-tabs.html) is a good idea.  \n"
