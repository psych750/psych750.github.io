[This one](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-full-tutorial-on-how-to-use-github-88466bac7d42) describes pushing and pulling from remote repositories. Confused about the difference between git and github? See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-git-and-github/).

    "\n",
    "- Lastly, please look through the [very basics of Python notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/python_basics.html) to get you ready for the first class. If you don't understand something in that notebook, don't worry about it, but come prepared to ask questions.\n",
