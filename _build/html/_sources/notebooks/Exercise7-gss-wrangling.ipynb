    "# Exercise 7 - Exploring the General Social Survey\n",

    "[Accept the exercise](https://classroom.github.com/a/-_Q2eUbC)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date is Wednesday at 11 for this one again. You can work in groups of 2 or individually. If you're looking for a partner, start a group whose name ends with `_team`.**  *If you'd like some extra time to submit extra credit, let me know.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will give you practice wrangling and analyzing the general social survey. The goals are to cement the `dplyr` skills we've been working on and to give you practice going from a description of a problem to figuring out how to get the data to give you answer -- a critical skill for social science and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please [follow these instructions](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) to download all the gss data and load it into R. I recommend the option using `drat` to install.  Notice that importing the data this way fixes the earlier issue we saw with numeric variables like `age` and `income` being imported as factors. So no need to do the `as.character %>% as.numeric` conversion. The factor levels remain the same, so a variable called `happy` has its largest level corresponding to a *least* happy response. Rename your variables or use `fct_rev` as necessary so that the variable name matches its values. You can see that many variables have labels built alongside to that you know what each numeric response corresponds to. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the label instead of the numeric response (e.g., \"male\" and \"female\" for `sex` instead of 1 and 2), load in the [labelled package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) and use `to_factor`, e.g.\n",

    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "gss$sex_l <- to_factor(gss$sex, levels=\"p\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "Please load in all the years into a dataframe called `gss_all`. You can complete the entire exercise using this dataframe, but one of the extra credit problems asks you to also use the longitututinal \"panel\" dataset."
