First create a new Reddit account or use one you already have. Then go [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and click on the `are you a developer? create an app...` button to create an application. Name it `psych750` and choose `script`. Add in a short description and use `http://localhost:8080` as the redirect uri. The usename is your regular username and the password is that user's password.

The study, titled Excess Death Rates for Republicans and Democrats During the COVID-19 Pandemic, used voter registration and death records to answer a question: is there a link between political affiliation and rates of COVID related death in the U.S.?\n",
      "\n",
      "The short answer is yes. ‚ÄúIn 2018 and the early parts of 2020, excess death rates for Republicans and Democrats are similar, and centered around zero,‚Äù the study said. ‚ÄúBoth groups experienced a similar large spike in excess deaths in the winter of 2020-2021. However, in the summer of 2021‚Äîafter vaccines were widely available‚Äîthe Republican excess death rate rose to nearly double that of Democrats, and this gap widened further in the winter of 2021.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "The study attributes this to the vaccine uptake disparity between Republicans and Democrats, which has been widely documented as more Republicans refused to take the vaccine; the most vocal anti-vax voices were Republican politicians and some conservative news outlets: ‚ÄúThe gap in excess death rates between Republicans and Democrats is concentrated in counties with low vaccination rates and only materializes after vaccines became widely available,‚Äù the study notes.\n",
      "It seems obvious in retrospect but remember how many of us didn't believe Hillary in the pizza basement meetings when she said Republicans would rather die than accept medicine from us.\n",
      "The math is pretty simple - 1.1 million dead, with a difference of roughly one third of that between the two parties (or 1100000/3 = 366,000). There are 435 districts. Assuming the deaths are relatively evenly spread between the districts that would mean about 840 deaths per district.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So far I dont think any races have been that close this year. Even so, it is likely that most of the GOP deaths were in heavy GOP districts and most of the Dem deaths in heavy Dem districts (both for practical math reasons and also the reality of where people died).  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So that would mean that the differential in swing districts is even smaller - maybe a few hundred votes, which again, is a threshold which hasnt been met in any House race this year, yet.  \n",
