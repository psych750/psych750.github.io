    "You can start in class if there is time and finish at home (Slack me your solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's try the opposite. Ensure that in your sequence, the repeats are at least `min_lag` elements apart and at most `max_lag` elments apart. For example, if `min_lag` is 3 and `max_lag` is 5, then there should be a repeat every 3-5 trials. This is not a back-to-back repeat! So if you have a sequence `a, b, c, d` and there's a `min_lag` of 3 and a `max_lag` of 3, then the next element must be `a`. If `min_lag` is 3 and `max_lag` is 4, then the next element could be `a` or it could be a new element `e` in which case the following element must be `a`."
