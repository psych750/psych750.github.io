If you go with the second solution, then that file won't change from what's in the starting code so it doesn't need to be updated. "

Remember that if your laptop is refreshing at 60Hz, each frame lasts ~17 msecs, i.e., .017 seconds. Refresh the position of the circle on each frame so that it's nice and smooth. The other circles should keep moving as normal when the circle you clicked on drops down. \n",

Now, clicking on a circle should cause it to stop moving horizontally and accelerate downwards (just like in part 4). If it hits a building, the building should turn red. When you run out of circles to click on, the game is over. If you want, put a little score in the corner that increases by 1 every time you hit a building.\n",
