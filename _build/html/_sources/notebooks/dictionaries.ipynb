Dictionaries store information in *key-value* pairs (in analogy to a conventional dictionary where the key would be a word and the value its meaning). In a Python dictionary, `keys` are usually strings, integers, or floats. You cannot use a list or dictionary as a key. Values can be pretty much anything. So you can have a dictionary where keys are strings and values are strings, lists, other dictionaries, or even functions.\n",
