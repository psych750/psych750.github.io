To install them, you'll want to first install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) which allows you to browse and install packages directly from within Sublime Text. Some useful ones are [Origami](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Origami), [SublimeREPL](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeREPL), [AdvancedCSV](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Advanced%20CSV), and [Terminal](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminal).\n",
