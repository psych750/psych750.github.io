# # Week by week schedule
# 
# 
# ## Prior to first class
# 
# - Sign up for the class Slack group
# 
# - Follow [“Download and Install” instructions](https://psych750.github.io/index.html) from the class site.
# 
# - If you’ve never used a Linux shell (or Mac terminal), watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag). Even if you've used a terminal before, go through this [basic linux commands notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/Shell_reference.html) as a refresher.
# 
# - Sign up for Github if you don’t already have an account (make sure you accept the invite to the class github site). We will be using the very basic capabilities of git: cloning, committing, checking out, and pushing.
# 
#      - If you’ve never used git and github, I recommend walking through these two tutorials: [1](https://githowto.com/setup) and [2](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-full-tutorial-on-how-to-use-github-88466bac7d42). The first focuses on working with git locally. The second describes pushing and pulling from remote repositories. Confused about the difference between git and github? See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-git-and-github/). This [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) is also very nice.
# 
# - If you’re shaky on what a computer file is, how files are stored, how your operting system knows that sound.wav is a sound file and sound.txt is a text file, [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM).
# 
# - Lastly, please look through the [very basics of Python notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/python_basics.html) to get you ready for the first class. If you don't understand something in that notebook, come prepared to ask a question about it.
