# # Week by week schedule
# 
# Here's the schedule so far. The **In class** sections list the things we'll be doing in class that week. **At home** sections tell you what you should do at home *before* that week's class. For example, you should complete Exercise 1 at home prior to the Week 2 class.  
# 
# This schedule is subject to update. I will be staying ahead of you by at least 2 weeks, meaning if you want to get an early start on the next 1 or 2 assignments, you can do it without worrying that something will change while you are working on it. If there an error, I will correct it and alert the class through Slack.
# 

# 
# ## Prior to first class
# 
# - Sign up for the class Slack group. The link was sent to your @wisc email.
# 
# - Follow "Download and Install" instructions (see sidebar on left). The instructions are slightly different depending on whether you have a PC or Mac.
# 
# - If you’ve never used a Linux shell (or Mac terminal), watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag). Even if you've used a terminal before, go through this [basic linux commands notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/Shell_reference.html) as a refresher.
# 
# - Sign up for Github if you don’t already have an account. We will be using the very basic capabilities of git: cloning, committing, checking out, and pushing.
# 
#      - If you’ve never used git and github, I recommend walking through two tutorials: [This one](https://githowto.com/setup) focuses on working with git locally. [This one](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-full-tutorial-on-how-to-use-github-88466bac7d42) describes pushing and pulling from remote repositories. Confused about the difference between git and github? See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-git-and-github/). This [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) is also very nice.
# 
# - If you’re shaky on what a computer file is, how files are stored, how your operating system knows that sound.wav is a sound file and sound.txt is a text file, [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM).
# 
# - Lastly, please look through the [very basics of Python notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/python_basics.html) to get you ready for the first class. If you don't understand something in that notebook, don't worry about it, but come prepared to ask questions.

# 
# ### At home
# 1. Look carefully through `my_first_function_library.py` function library in the Exercise 5 repository and try to understand the code. Play with it. Explore.
# 2. Finish Exercise 5, using appropriate functionality from `my_first_function_library.py`
# 3. Ensure your R-studio environment works and that you have the following libraries installed: `tidyverse, ggplot2, psych, psychTools, lme4`. R notebooks don't run that well inside Visual Code Studio, so we'll be running them inside R Studio instead.
# 4. Generate stroop data for Exercise 4 by running yourself on the stroop task: `git checkout Exercise_4_collect_data` from the solution repository and run `exercise_4.py`. Use your github name as the subject code. It will maximize the window and run you on 100 trials. There's a break in the middle. Please try to do the best you can. Push the generated data to your Exercise_4 folder and tag it as 'Exercise_4_data_your_githubname`. If you worked in a team **Each team member should run themselves and push their data**.
# 5. After the solution for Exercise 5 is posted - Generate >=128 trials (at least one block) of data for the tilt-adjustment task (Exercise 5) using the provided code which you can access with `git checkout Exercise_5_collect_data`. Use your github name as the subject code (as before, each student should generate their own data even if you worked in a team). You'll notice that there are two conditions, upResp==left and upResp==right. These control whether scrolling up moves the bar to the left or to the right. If you were born in an odd month, choose `left`. If you were born in an even month, choose `right`.  Push the data into the data folder inside your exercise 5 repository.
#
