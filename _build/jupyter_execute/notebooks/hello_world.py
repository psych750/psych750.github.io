# "Hello world" in Python
# ===
# When programmers are learning a new language, we tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message "Hello world!" this is a simple program that shows whether your computer is properly set up to run Python programs.

# In[1]:


print('Hello Python world!')


# Note: If you are using Python 2.7, this would be:

# In[2]:


print "Hello Python world!"


# If it works, congratulations! You just ran your first Python program.
