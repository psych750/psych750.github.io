    "- If you’ve never used a Linux shell (or Mac terminal), watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag). Even if you've used a terminal before, go through this [basic linux commands notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/Shell_reference.html) as a refresher.\n",

[This one](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-full-tutorial-on-how-to-use-github-88466bac7d42) describes pushing and pulling from remote repositories. Confused about the difference between git and github? See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-git-and-github/). This [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) is also very nice.\n",

    "- If you’re shaky on what a computer file is, how files are stored, how your operating system knows that sound.wav is a sound file and sound.txt is a text file, [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly, please look through the [very basics of Python notebook](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/python_basics.html) to get you ready for the first class. If you don't understand something in that notebook, don't worry about it, but come prepared to ask questions.\n",
