The function should produce a sequences of letters, one per line, such that calls to *repetition* with various parameters, generate the following outputs.

Let's code a basic trial list for an experiment in which we display an image on either the left or the right side of the screen. Both sides of the screen are then masked, and we are interested in measuring people's ability (e.g., accuracy, reaction time) in responding whether the image was on the right or left side of the screen, while comparing responses on masked vs. nonmasked trials. \n",

    "## Randomizing\n",
    "3 - The trial list above has the trial structure you want, but obviously you wouldn't want to show someone trials in this order because it's completely predictable. It's a good idea to have your `generate trials` routine do all the randomization ahead of time such that your trials file (here, trialList.txt) contains the exact trial order that will be seen by a participant. There are two reasons. First, this lets you modularize all the trial handling outside of your main experiment script. Second, it allows you to save individual trial files that show the trial order seen by a given participant. It comes in handy for making sure your trial list is set up as you want it. So: let's go ahead and *randomize the trial list before printing.* "
