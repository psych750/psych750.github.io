    "# Exercise 6 - Exploring the tilt adjustment data\n",

    "Due date is Wednesday at 11 for this one since it was posted late.\n",

    "Because we'll be putting together a continuous notebook (rather than developing a program) for this exercise, there's no need to have multiple tags. I encourage you though to make regular commits as you're working on the assignment. The final commit should be tagged `Exercise_6_done` and have a single notebook called exercise_6.Rmd that has clearly titled chunks (see starter code). Insert additional chunks as you see fit. Make sure you push *all* the files in your working directory to the repository, not just the Rmd file. This will help us run your code."

We want to know whether people are mis-estimating the tilt of the numbers and whether this mis-estimation is different for left-leaning and right-leaning numbers, and also whether it changes when the numbers are mirror-reversed so they don't really look like numbers anymore."

    "Inside the raw_data subfolder are individual data files. Each file has a column header and is tab-delimitted. We need to read them into a single R dataframe (`dat`).  Here are two solutions; pic one. The **first solution** uses R to read in individual files and concatenate them into a common dataframe. If you want to do that, look [here](https://sparkbyexamples.com/r-programming/r-read-multiple-csv-files/). The **second solution** is to concatenate them in your shell environment (i.e., terminal) and then just read in that single file using `read.csv()`. See [here](https://psych750.github.io/notebooks/Shell_reference.html#combine-concatenate-two-or-more-files-and-write-the-output-to-another-file) for how to concatenate multiple files into one (the only very slightly tricky part is what to do about the column headers). \n",
