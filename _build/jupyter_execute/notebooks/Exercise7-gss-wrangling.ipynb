    "# Exercise 7 - Exploring the General Social Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "[Accept the exercise](https://classroom.github.com/a/ta2ze5ou)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will give you practice wrangling and analyzing the general social survey. The goals are to cement the `dplyr` skills we've been working on and to give you practice going from a description of a problem to figuring out how to get the data to give you answer -- a critical skill for doing social / data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please [follow these instructions](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) to download all the gss data and load it into R. I recommend the using `drat` to install.  Notice that importing the data this way fixes the earlier issue we saw with numeric variables like `age` and `income` being imported as factors. So no need to do the `as.character %>% as.numeric` conversion. Be mindful of the factor levels because they don't always correspond to what they ought to be. For example, variable called `happy` has its largest level corresponding to a *least* happy response. Rename your variables or use `fct_rev` as necessary so that the variable name matches its values. You can see that many variables have labels built alongside to that you know what each numeric response corresponds to. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the label instead of the numeric response (e.g., \"male\" and \"female\" for `sex` instead of 1 and 2), load in the [labelled](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) package and use `to_factor`, e.g.\n",

    "```r\n",
    "gss_all$sex_l <- to_factor(gss_all$sex, levels=\"p\")\n",

    "Please load in all the years into a dataframe called `gss_all` using the instructions [here](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/). You can complete the entire exercise using this dataframe, calling on individual years as needed."

    "Recall from the GSS activity that while political orientation (`polviews`) was associated with endorsement of human evolution (`evolved`), it was not strongly associated with endorsement of the evolution of elephants (`evolved2`). Visualize this interaction in the clearest way possible. Because `evolved2` was only asked in 2016 and 2018, use the (combined) 2016 and 2018 data for this graph (i.e., only base your analyses on the years 2016 and 2018)."

Feel free to look at variables coding for people's employment type as well. As part of your solution for this part, report one or more main effects, an interaction (the more interesting and unexpected, the better), and a visualization that helps you gain insight into a pattern that's hard to appreciate by just looking at the numbers.\n",
