# # Now let's write some code!
# 

# 1. Write a `for` loop to print out the numbers 0 through 5
# 1. Write a `for` loop to print out the numbers 2 through 8. Now do another one to print 9 through 0 (i.e., backwards)
#     <div class="alert alert-block alert-info">
#     Use help(range) to see some other things you can do with the range function</div>
# 1. Given the list ['one', 'two','three','four'], write code that will print: 'one and a two and a three and a four'
# 1. Write a bit of code using for loop(s) that print out the following sequence:
# ```
# 0
# 01
# 012
# 0123
# 01234
# 012345
# ```
# 
# ```{note}
# This one's gonna be challenging to people who have not programmed before. Give it a try and then turn to your neighbor and talk about how you might solve it.
# ```
# 
# ```{warning}
# If you're writing your program in the Python Shell or in a Jupyter Notebook, Python will automatically append a newline to anything you print. To keep it from doing that end the print statement with a comman, e.g., `print i,`. If you're writing the code in a text editor and executing using `python filename.py`, you can keep using `print` in the normal way.
