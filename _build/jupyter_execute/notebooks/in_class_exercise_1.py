# # Let's warm up them neurons
# 

# Now that we've gotten your environment all set up, let's switch gears and do some actual coding.

# 1. Write a `for` loop to print out the numbers 0 through 5
# 2. Write a `for` loop to print out the numbers 2 through 8. Now do another one to print 9 through 0 (i.e., backwards)
# ```tip
# Use help(range) to see some other things you can do with the range function
# ```
# 3. Given the list ['one', 'two','three','four'], write code that will print: 'one and a two and a three and a four'
# 4. Write a bit of code using for loop(s) that print out the following sequence:
# ```
# 1
# 12
# 123
# 1234
# 12345
# ```
# 
# ```{note}
# This one's gonna be challenging to people who have not programmed before. Give it a try and then turn to your neighbor and talk about how you might solve it.
# ```
# ```{warning}
# If you're writing your program in the Python Shell or in a Jupyter Notebook, Python will automatically append a newline to anything you print. To keep it from doing that end the print statement with a comma, e.g., `print i,`. If you're writing the code in a text editor and executing using `python filename.py`, you won't get a newline. If you want one, add `\n` to the end of your string.
# ```
# 5. If you've done any coding before, the last one was probably quite easy. Here's one that's slightly more challenging. Write some code that uses a variable `rows` to print the following pattern. 
# If `row==1`, then the following pattern should be printed:
# ```
# o
# ```
# 
# If `rows==5`, then the following pattern should be printed.
# 
# ```
#      o
#     ooo
#    ooooo
#   ooooooo
#  ooooooooo
# ```
# If it doesn't look like a pyramid, you're not doing it right ;)
