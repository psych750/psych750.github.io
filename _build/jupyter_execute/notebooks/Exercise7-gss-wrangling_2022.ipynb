    "# Exercise 7 - Exploring the General Social Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "[Accept the exercise]()\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will give you practice wrangling and analyzing the general social survey. The goals are to cement the `dplyr` skills we've been working on and to give you practice going from a description of a problem to figuring out how to get the data to give you answer -- a critical skill for doing social / data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please [follow these instructions](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/) to download all the gss data and load it into R. I recommend the using `drat` to install.  Notice that importing the data this way fixes the earlier issue we saw with numeric variables like `age` and `income` being imported as factors. So no need to do the `as.character %>% as.numeric` conversion. Be mindful of the factor levels because they don't always correspond to what they ought to be. For example, variable called `happy` has its largest level corresponding to a *least* happy response. Rename your variables or use `fct_rev` as necessary so that the variable name matches its values. You can see that many variables have labels built alongside to that you know what each numeric response corresponds to. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to access the label instead of the numeric response (e.g., \"male\" and \"female\" for `sex` instead of 1 and 2), load in the [labelled](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/labelled/vignettes/intro_labelled.html) package and use `to_factor`, e.g.\n",

    "```r\n",
    "gss$sex_l <- to_factor(gss$sex, levels=\"p\")\n",
