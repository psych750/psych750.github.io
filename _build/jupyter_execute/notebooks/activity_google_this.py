# # Google ***this!***
# 
# You've probably realized at this point that your ability to solve various problems -- coding, data wrangling, graphing -- is closely related to your ability to effectively google stuff. We are not born knowing how to do this. Fortunately, there is quite a bit of consistency in how people ask and answer questions (or at least there are certain types of questions/answers that attain prominence in search engine results). This means that if you ask the question in the right way, you're much more likely to find an answer. 
# 
# So let's try this. I've come up with a series of graphing (ggplot) and wrangling (tidyverse/dplyr) problems. Go through them and for each, enter in your initial google search, a better search if the first one didn't work, and the URL to the page showing (what looks to you to be) a working solution.
